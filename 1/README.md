# Caesar cipher

- The Caesar cipher is a cipher method/algorithm.
- Elements of a given plaintext string are coded in numbers.
- An arbitrary numerical value called a "key" is then selected.
- These numerical elements are then added to, or subtracted from.
- The string of numbers made with this transform is called "ciphertext".
